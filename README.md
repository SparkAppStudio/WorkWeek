# For Developers

We are now on the Xcode 9.3 - Swift 4.1

Before building the project with Xcode you'll need to build the dependencies
using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). It's probably best to use the same script that CI uses to keep everything consistent. 

```
./buddybuild_carthage_command.sh
```
